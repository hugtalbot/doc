**_It is advised to read through this entire doc page before getting started_**

Prerequisites for Windows
=========================

### Compiler

You need to have Visual Studio 2015 or higher installed. We recommend Visual Studio 2015 (tested on [our Dashboard](http://www.sofa-framework.org/dash/)).

Visit [Visual Studio downloads page](https://www.visualstudio.com/fr-fr/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx).

**Note**: you can also get [Build Tools for VS2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159) or [Build Tools for VS2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/fr/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15) to install MSVC without all the Visual Studio package.


### CMake: Makefile generator

You need to have CMake 3.1 or higher installed.  
The easiest way to do this is to get the installer from the [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/).

**Note**: during the install process, we advise to choose the option "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users" (as shown in the image below) in order to be able to easily run cmake from any directory.

### [optional] Ninja: build system

Ninja is an alternative to NMake. It has a better handling of incremental builds.  
You can download the latest release from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases).

To use Ninja, do not forget to set the CMake generator to "Codeblocks - Ninja" (as explained in [Generate a Makefile with CMake](#generate-a-makefile-with-cmake)).


Required dependencies
=====================

Finally, SOFA requires some specific dependencies:

-   **Qt** (>= 5.5.0)  
    We recommend to install Qt from [the unified installer](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers).  

-   **Boost** (>= 1.54.0)  
    Find the latest official Boost installer for your Visual Studio version
    [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/).
    Beware of the correspondance between Visual Studio and MSVC versions (VS-2015 == MSVC-14.0, VS-2017 == MSVC-14.1).

-   **Eigen** (>= 3.3.4)
    Download the latest Eigen release [here](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).
    Unzip in the location of your choice, preferrably at `C:\` or `C:\Program files` for better discoverability by CMake find-modules (remember to extract the inner folder and rename it to `Eigen3` or `Eigen`).

-   **Python 2.7**  
    Get Python 2.7.x (32 or 64 bit) on [python.org download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

-   **Additional libraries**: libPNG, libJPEG, libTIFF, Zlib, Glew
    -   VS2015 users: download the [Windows dependency pack for VS2015](https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/WinDepPack/VS-2015/latest).
    -   VS2017 users: download the [Windows dependency pack for VS2017](https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/WinDepPack/VS-2017/latest).
    -   VS2019 users: download the [Windows dependency pack for VS2017](https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/WinDepPack/VS-2017/latest) (VS2019 is compatible with VS2017 binaries).

    You will unzip them **in SOFA source directory** (e.g. sofa/src/) after cloning SOFA (see below).


### [optional] PATH modification

To complete the dependencies integration, you may add Boost and Qt to your PATH (it will ease their detection by CMake).  
**Boost**: add `your/Boost/path` and `your/Boost/path/libXX-msvc-XX`  
**Qt**: add `your/Qt/path/msvcXXXX_XX/bin` and `your/Qt/path/msvcXXXX_XX/lib`


Building on Windows
===================


## Setting up your source and build directories

To set up clean repositories, we propose to arrange the SOFA directories
as follows:

-   sofa/
    -   src/
    -   build/
        -   v19.12/
        -   master/

**First**, download the sources from Git repository:

Get the current **stable** version on the v19.12 branch:
``` {.bash .stable}
git clone -b v19.12 https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa.git sofa/src/
```

**OR** get the development **unstable** version on the master branch:
``` {.bash .unstable}
git clone -b master https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa.git sofa/src/
```

**Next**, unzip in your sources folder (sofa/src/) the **SOFA
dependencies for Windows** you downloaded before.

**Finally**, you should have something like this:

## Generate a solution (\*.sln) with CMake

### Launch CMake

If you didn't do it yet, create a build/ folder respecting directories
arrangement.

In the "Start" menu of Windows, you can search for a program called "_Native Build Tools Command Prompt_". As shown in the figure below, you should be able to find the _Command Prompt_ corresponding to your VisualStudio install:

![](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SearchCommandPrompt.png)

**Launch this _Command Prompt_ as administrator**.

If you installed cmake using the option "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users" [as mentioned above](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/getting-started/build/windows/#cmake-makefile-generator), **type "cmake-gui"** in the _Native Build Tools Command Prompt_ as shown in the image below.
If you get an error due to `'cmake-gui' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, it means that the system PATH does not correctly include the path to cmake-gui. In this case, you need to provide the full path to your cmake-gui.

![](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TypeCMakeGUI.png)


### Setup CMake options


Once CMake-GUI is open, set source folder with **Browse Source** and build
folder with **Browse Build**.

Next, run **Configure**. A popup window will ask you to specify the generator for the project. If you installed Ninja, select "Codeblocks - Ninja". Otherwise, select your version of Visual Studio. If you have Visual Studio 2015 and a 64-bit system select "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64". Keep "Use default native compilers" selected, and press "Finish".

Now, you can see in the CMake GUI all options available to configure the SOFA project. You can for instance choose the type of build (Release/Debug/RelWithDebInfo) using the variable `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. By default, set it to `Release`. You can also tune the plugins you want to activate/compile or de-activate. For instance, the image plugin can be activated by setting the flag `PLUGIN_IMAGE` to true.

**Note**:

  - To solve Qt detection errors, click on **Add Entry** and add `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` with path `C:/Qt/X.X/msvcXXXX` matching your Qt MSVC folder. Example: `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/Qt/5.7/msvc2015_64` and **Configure** again.

  - To solve Boost detection errors, click on **Add Entry** and add `BOOST_ROOT` with type **PATH** and value `C:/boost/boost_1_XX_X` matching your Boost lib folder.   Example: `BOOST_ROOT=C:/boost/boost_1_61_0` and **Configure** again.


You need to **run Configure again**. Configuration must be run twice since SOFA requires two passes to manage the module dependencies. You can then customize your version of SOFA, activate or deactivate plugins and functionalities.

If you have some errors, make absolutely sure all of your dependencies and your compilator are targeting the same architecture. For example, if you are not sure
that the compiler is correctly set, do not hesitate to select it manually in the cmake-gui configuration screen instead of keeping the default ("Use default native
compilers").

When you are ready, press **Generate**. This will create your Visual Studio solution (Sofa.sln file in the build/ directory) or your makefiles if you chose another generator.


#### Troubleshooting: Qt detection errors

During CMake configuration, a dev warning due to Qt may appear:

    CMake Warning (dev) at YOUR_QT_MSVC_PATH/lib/cmake/Qt5Core/Qt5CoreMacros.cmake:224 (configure_file):
    configure_file called with unknown argument(s):

    COPY_ONLY

    Call Stack (most recent call first):
    applications/projects/Modeler/exec/CMakeLists.txt:14 (qt5_add_resources)

This is just a typo with Qt5CoreMacros.cmake file. It uses COPY\_ONLY
instead of COPYONLY. Simply edit your Qt5CoreMacros.cmake, replace
COPY\_ONLY with COPYONLY and **Configure** again.



## Compile

To build SOFA in Visual Studio, simply **open the generated Sofa.sln**. Finally, **build the solution** using the Visual Studio interface as shown in the image below:

![](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/build-visual.png)

If you chose another generator you will have to run the generator from the build directory.
Example with Ninja: go in the build dir and run `ninja`.

Time for a coffee!
